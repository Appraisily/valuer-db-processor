# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to publish your code to GitHub:

## 1. Initialize Git Repository (if not already done)

```bash
# Navigate to your project root directory
cd /path/to/valuer-db-processor

# Initialize git repository if not already done
git init

# Check git status to see untracked files
git status
```

## 2. Create .gitignore File

```bash
# Create .gitignore file to exclude sensitive information and unnecessary files
```

Let's create a .gitignore file with the following content:

```
# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so
.Python
env/
build/
develop-eggs/
dist/
downloads/
eggs/
.eggs/
lib/
lib64/
parts/
sdist/
var/
*.egg-info/
.installed.cfg
*.egg
.pytest_cache/

# Virtual Environment
venv/
ENV/
.env
.env.*
!.env.example

# Database
*.db
*.sqlite3

# Local development
local_data/
local_images/

# IDE
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp
*.swo

# Logs
logs/
*.log

# OS specific
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

## 3. Add and Commit Your Files

```bash
# Add all files (excluding those in .gitignore)
git add .

# Make the initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit of Valuer DB Processor service"
```

## 4. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Enter repository name (e.g., "valuer-db-processor")
3. Add a description: "Service for processing auction data, downloading images, and storing data in a database"
4. Choose Public or Private repository visibility
5. Do not initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click "Create repository"

## 5. Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the GitHub repository, you'll see commands to push an existing repository. Use the commands shown in GitHub:

```bash
# Add the remote GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/valuer-db-processor.git

# Push the code to the main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 6. Verify Repository

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page to see your code
2. Make sure all expected files are there
3. Check that no sensitive information (like API keys, passwords, etc.) was accidentally uploaded

## 7. Create README.md File (if missing)

If you don't already have a comprehensive README.md file, create one to help others understand your project:

```markdown
# Valuer DB Processor

A service for processing auction data, downloading images, and storing structured data in a database.

## Overview

This service:
- Processes JSON files containing auction data
- Extracts and downloads images referenced in the data
- Uploads images to Google Cloud Storage (or stores locally for development)
- Stores structured auction data in a database (PostgreSQL in production, SQLite for development)
- Provides a RESTful API for data submission and processing status

## Technology Stack

- Python 3.10+
- FastAPI for API endpoints
- AsyncIO for asynchronous processing
- PostgreSQL (production) and SQLite (development) for data storage
- Google Cloud Storage for image storage
- Docker for containerization
- Deployed on Google Cloud Run

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure environment variables
6. Run the application: `uvicorn src.main:app --reload`

## API Endpoints

- `GET /health`: Health check endpoint
- `POST /process`: Submit auction data for processing

## Deployment

The service is deployed on Google Cloud Run with connection to Cloud SQL and Cloud Storage.
See `gcp-setup-commands.md` for detailed deployment instructions.
```

## 8. Further Development

After the initial push, you can continue working on your local repository and push changes using:

```bash
# Make changes to files
...

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"

# Push changes to GitHub
git push
```
